1. **Discovery call:** Intro meeting to understand goals and scope.
2. **Proposal:** We send a detailed plan, timeline, and quote.
3. **Kickoff workshop:** Align vision and priorities.
4. **Design/build:** Weekly check-ins, open feedback, and collaboration.
5. **Delivery & support:** Final handoff, with post-launch assistance.
